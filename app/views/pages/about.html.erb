<h1>Looking to be a great addition to your team.</h1>
<strong><p> Software development has been a passion of mine for a while now starting back in 2014 when I was repairing iphones. So, after looking around I decided to enroll in McFadden Technical School in Davie, Florida. At MTS I learn and worked on HTML,CSS,Bootstrap and wordpress for must off the 10 months I was enrolled. Upon completion of the program I wanted to learn more, I needed to learn backend development.So, I moved here to Dallas, Texas to continue my learning at Tech Talent South where my Ruby on Rails journey started.</p></strong>
