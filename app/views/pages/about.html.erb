          <p> Software development has been a passion of mine for a while now dating back to 2014 when I was repaired smart phones. After browsing potential institutes, I decided to enroll in McFadden Technical School in Davie, Florida. At MTS, I worked thoroughly with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Wordpress the entirety of my enrollment. Upon completion of the program, the desire to learn more resonated within me. I wanted to master back end development. I made an ambitious move to Dallas to further my education at Tech Talent South where my Ruby on Rails journey started.</p>
